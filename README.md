# Tag-Boss
This is a Google Chrome extension that I have been using for a while now and decided to make my first public repository for here on github.   It is JavaScript and HTML, and since neither of those are my strongest languages, at present, probably not very good but it is a work in progress.

# The Original Purpose of the Extension
To allow the user to manipulate various elements on the page by way of their HTML tags. For instance, I often use it to extract all of the links on a page to copy and paste them into a text file. I had plans for adding the capability to copy all of a certain tag to either the clipboard or write to a file. I also want to add fuctionality to modify things like the width of the columns in a table, the width of the table itself, conversion of tables to SQL, etc... 


# Regarding Chrome Extensions
The file called "content.js" is the file that is loaded automatically when a web page is loaded. This is the main extension file. The other files are called by this file. There are four icon files as well, different sizes.

# Document Object Model
This extension relies heavily on the DOM. Much of the JavaScript references the DOM, or manipulates the page by way of the DOM.
